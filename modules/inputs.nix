# This repo was generated with github:vic/flake-file#dendritic template.
# Run `nix run .#write-flake` after changing any input.
#
# Inputs can be placed in any module, the best practice is to have them
# as close as possible to their actual usage.
# See: https://vic.github.io/dendrix/Dendritic.html#minimal-and-focused-flakenix
#
# For our template, we enable home-manager and nix-darwin by default, but
# you are free to remove them if not being used by you.
